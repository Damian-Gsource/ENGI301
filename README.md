# ENGI301: Drone project
Repository for ENGI301 course work
The first project that was worked on for this course was a DIY drone/quadcopter fitted with a camera.
This drone would be able to fly remotely and have a camera attached to it as well. It is worth noting that the drone is a continuous work in progress.
